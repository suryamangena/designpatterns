# DesignPatterns
Elegant solutions for repeating problems. One of the benefit is to communicate with in team in more abstract way. Total 23 Design Patterns exists.

## Design Patterns are divided into three categories
1) Creational
2) Structural
3) Behavioural

## Coupling
How much a class coupled or dependent on another class. We have to built loosely coupled classes. We can achieve this by using interfaces.

## Interfaces
Contract specifies capabilities that class can provide. Used to build loosely coupled applications by using dependency injection.

## Four Core Principles of OOPS
1) Encapsulation
   - Bundling the data and methods applied on data with in a class/unit and hiding the values or state of object inside a class. By this we can prevent an
    object going to invalid state.
2) Abstraction
   - Reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details. We can change the implementation details without affecting the other class.
3) Inheritance
   - Inheriting the properties of parent class to child class. Reusing the code.
4) Polymorphism
   - Ability of object take many forms.


## UML (Unified Modeling Language)
    Uses to represent classes and relations.

## Memento Pattern
    Ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback)

## State Pattern


## Single Responsibility Principle
